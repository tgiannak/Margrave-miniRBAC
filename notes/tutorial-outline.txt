Step 1: Figure out what information you want to be able to express and capture using your DSL.

Step 2: Create ASTs for that data.

Step 3: Define what the data means logically.

Step 4: Write the translation from the ASTs to Margrave.

Step 5: If there is a useful syntax for writing down the information you are
trying to capture, write macros to parse the DSL.

Step 6: If there is an output format that works more clearly with your input
syntax, then write a function to transform scenarios to that format.

Step 7: Write a high-level API that handles passing data and queries through
Margrave.
